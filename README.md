This is a pure Javascript side scrolling game based on a tutorial by Coderdojo.

While going through that with my son, he asked if we could make a Pok√©mon game instead.
So I browsed the internet for a Sandshrew image, figured out how to make it into a spritesheet with transparent background, and added it to the game.
I suggested some SID music and my son picked the Shadow of the Beast track you can hear now. 
Furthermore, I tweaked the game to have some difficulty progression.

You can download the game, figure out a way to host it (I suggested AWS S3 with static website hosting), open `game.html` in your browser and off you go!
